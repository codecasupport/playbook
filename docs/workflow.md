Publishing California state government open-source projects to CodeCA OpenSource adopts the code.json data management protocol, the same employed by the U.S. Government’s [code.gov](https://code.gov) and NASA’s [code.nasa.gov](https://code.nasa.gov).

## code-ca.json

As code.gov and code.nasa.gov do, CodeCA OpenSource will leverage the JSON protocol to publish publicly-available state open-source projects.

About JSON:

*In computing, JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format used for asynchronous browser–server communication. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)*)

The code-ca.json file allows agencies to create a simple file from an established template, input information related to all of the organization’s public open-source projects (i.e., repositories), then post this file on its primary website for data harvesting into the code.ca.gov platform.

## code-ca.json Placement
The code-ca.json file needs to be placed in the root directory of an agency's website.  
```www.example.ca.gov/code-ca.json```
